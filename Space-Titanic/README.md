This was part of a Kaggle Contest which aims to find if a person was transported to another galaxy or not
I did some basic EDA found out the redundant data fields and removed the NaN data from the set and then applied various models on it
I got 80% accuracy on the Kaggle Website tester with my Gradient Boosting Algorithm
Of Course the accuracy could be improved as this was just a lazy attempt but i will try to improve it soon.
